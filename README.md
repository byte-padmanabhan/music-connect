ðŸ“– About the Project

ChordSense was born from a simple idea: What if you could learn a new genre while staying true to your roots?

Imagine being a Carnatic musician curious about Western harmonies, or a guitarist exploring ragas. By blending traditions with modern sounds, ChordSense helps you create music that is authentic and globally resonant.

Our platform makes this possible through:
âœ” Guided Learning
âœ” AI-powered Suggestions (Gemini AI)
âœ” Cross-genre Collaboration

Whether you want to experiment, grow your skills, or create the next big hit, ChordSense is your space to learn, collaborate, and innovate.
